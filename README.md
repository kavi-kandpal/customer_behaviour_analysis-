🛍️ Customer Shopping Behaviour Analysis

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis pipeline that transforms raw customer shopping data into meaningful business insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze customer shopping patterns, understand purchasing behavior, and visualize key trends that can support data-driven decision making.

The workflow follows three major stages:

Data Cleaning with Python

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL

Interactive Dashboard Creation in Power BI

🧹 Data Cleaning (Python)

Data preprocessing was performed using Python to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis.

Key steps included:

Handling missing values

Removing duplicate records

Standardizing column formats

Correcting inconsistent data entries

Libraries used:

Pandas

NumPy

🗄️ Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)

SQL was used to explore the cleaned dataset and extract meaningful insights.

Some of the analysis performed:

Customer purchase frequency analysis

Subscription vs non-subscription behavior

Product and category performance

Spending pattern trends

Identifying high-value customers

This stage helped uncover patterns and relationships in customer shopping behavior.

📊 Data Visualization (Power BI)

An interactive dashboard was built in Power BI to present insights visually.

Dashboard features include:

KPIs for sales and customer activity

Customer segmentation visuals

Purchase trend analysis

Filters for dynamic exploration

The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly understand trends and make informed decisions.
